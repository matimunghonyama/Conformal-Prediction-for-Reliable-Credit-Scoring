# Conformal Prediction for Credit Scoring


In this project, I explored the application of conformal prediction to improve the reliability of credit scoring models. The goal was to build a model that not only predicts whether a loan applicant will default but also provides a measure of uncertainty with each prediction.

## 1. Data Simulation & Exploration
To begin, I simulated a dataset that mirrors real-world credit scoring scenarios. The dataset includes various features such as credit history, loan status, and demographic information. After generating the data, I conducted an initial exploration to understand its structure and quality, checking for any anomalies, distribution patterns, and overall consistency. This step was crucial to ensure that the simulated data accurately represented the problem space.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
Next, I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values through imputation and scaled the features to ensure they were on a comparable scale. I also clipped extreme values to minimize their influence on the model. These preprocessing steps were necessary to prepare the data for effective modeling.

## 3. Feature Engineering
In this phase, I focused on enhancing the dataset by creating new features that could provide more predictive power. I selected the most relevant features based on their importance and visualized key relationships in the data, such as the distribution of credit scores relative to loan amounts. Feature engineering allowed me to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

## 4. Model Selection
For the core of the project, I chose a RandomForestClassifier due to its robustness and ability to handle complex interactions between features. I trained the model on a training dataset, fine-tuning it to achieve a good balance between bias and variance.

## 5. Model Calibration
To improve the reliability of the probability estimates, I applied CalibratedClassifierCV for model calibration. This step was important because it adjusted the raw output probabilities of the model to better reflect the true likelihood of an event, which is critical for making informed decisions in credit scoring.

## 6. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP)
I implemented Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) to generate prediction intervals around the model’s predictions. This involved defining a nonconformity function and calibrating it using a separate validation dataset. The result was a set of prediction intervals that quantify the uncertainty of each prediction, providing more informative outputs than a simple binary classification.

## 7. Evaluation & Validation
After generating the prediction intervals, I evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. I also analyzed the prediction intervals to ensure they were reliable and correctly captured the uncertainty of the predictions. This evaluation confirmed that the model was not only accurate but also capable of providing meaningful confidence levels.

## 8. Visualization & Interpretation
I created visualizations to illustrate the prediction intervals and the overall performance of the model. These visuals were instrumental in interpreting the results and communicating the findings. The plots helped me and others understand the model’s predictions and the associated uncertainties in a clear and intuitive way.

## 9. Reporting & Deployment
Finally, I compiled all the findings, visualizations, and interpretations into a comprehensive report. If required, the model could be deployed for real-time credit scoring, offering a more transparent and reliable decision-making tool.

This project demonstrates how conformal prediction can be applied to credit scoring to provide not just predictions, but also a quantifiable measure of uncertainty. By following a structured approach from data simulation to model deployment, I was able to build a more informative and trustworthy credit scoring model.
