Conformal Prediction for Reliable Credit Scoring

In the world of finance, accurately assessing a customer's creditworthiness is critical. Traditional models often provide a binary decision — accept or reject — based on the likelihood of repayment. However, these models lack a mechanism to quantify the uncertainty associated with their predictions.

To address this, I implemented a Conformal Prediction model for credit scoring. Conformal prediction provides prediction intervals, offering a range of likely outcomes rather than a single point estimate. This allows for a more informed decision-making process by accounting for uncertainty in predictions.

In this project, I trained a Random Forest model on a synthetic credit scoring dataset and applied conformal prediction to generate prediction intervals. These intervals give us a confidence measure, helping to avoid risky decisions based on uncertain predictions.
